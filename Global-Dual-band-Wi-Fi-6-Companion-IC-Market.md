# Global Dual-band Wi-Fi 6 Companion IC Market 2023-2030: Trends, Challenges, and Future Growth
This, in turn, comes to complement a significant increase in the global dual-band Wi-Fi 6 companion IC market, driven by increasing Wi-Fi 6 technology adoption across a wide array of industries. It is the newest generation for wireless networking technology, better and more efficient than all its predecessors with enhanced speed, efficiency, and capacity. Dual-band can connect to both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, supporting more devices with lesser interference. A boost in demand for high-speed internet, a rise in connected devices, and proliferation of smart homes, IoT, and enterprise networking are driving this market.

Market Drivers
Growing Demand for High-Speed Internet: The increasing consumption of high-definition video streaming, online gaming, and above all, the necessity for a reliable connection to work from home and pursue education, drove demand for high-speed internet up. Wi-Fi 6, offering enhanced capabilities in providing a faster and stable connection, hence becomes the first choice among consumers and enterprises alike.

Proliferation of connected devices: The connected devices at home or in the workplace are growing rapidly. Hence, this leads to network congestion as a result. Therefore, Wi-Fi 6 is hence necessarily required to handle several devices simultaneously without affecting the speed or performance. This is further enhanced by its dual-band feature, wherein it switches between bands according to their requirement; this in turn reduces interference and thus improves the overall efficiency of the network.

Expanding Smart Homes and IoT: With more devices joining the home network, the smart home market has been growing day by day. Wi-Fi 6 comes in to help in supporting these devices since it provides the required bandwidth and low latency for their smooth running. Moreover, with IoT influence spilling over into many other industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation, the need for robust and reliable wireless connections is also on the rise, and that is what Wi-Fi 6 can help with.

Enterprise Networking: With the increasing number of devices at work, rising network security, and growing need for more connectivity on remote work, Wi-Fi 6 is being installed in many enterprises. The dual-band feature will be more engaging within an enterprise environment where different devices and applications require varied bandwidth and performance from a single device or network resource in this case.

Challenges to the Market
High Costs: Integration of Wi-Fi 6 technology, including dual-band companion ICs, is expensive. Therefore, this can be a big challenge to SMEs and consumers within the emerging markets. The new infrastructure or the upgrading of the existing ones to accommodate Wi-Fi 6 comes at a high cost, which may be a challenge to many people, thereby hindering it from being adopted by many.

Compatibility Problems: While Wi-Fi 6 itself is backward compatible with older Wi-Fi standards, some of the old devices may not be able to enjoy too much of the enhanced features that come with Wi-Fi 6. This would be a problem of compatibility and likely become one of the major obstacles to the diffusion of Wi-Fi 6 technologies across the board, especially in environments where old and new devices coexist.

Lack of Awareness: With all the advantages of WiFi 6, there exists a general lack of awareness among consumers and enterprise customers about the accruable benefits by upgrading to this technology. Few people realize that Wi-Fi 6 allows for better performance with more efficient functions, and thus this may cause the adoption rate to slow down.
