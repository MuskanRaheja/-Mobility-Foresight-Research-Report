 Market Drivers
Environmental Regulations: France has been leading in the development and implementation of environmental policies assuring the minimization of waste and carbon emissions. The government has implemented various regulations that require the usage of sustainable packaging. An example is the 2020 law called the Anti-Waste for a Circular Economy (AGEC), which highlights plastic waste reduction measures and encourages the use of recyclable and biodegradable packaging materials.

Awareness and Consumer Demand: French consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the impact packaging has on the environment. Companies have responded with an increased demand for products using effective green packaging methods: they are, after all, willing to pay a premium for 'green' options. This change in consumer preference is actually what is coercing the change in companies' policy toward green packaging solutions.

Corporate Responsibility: Many companies all over France have started incorporating green packaging into their corporate social responsibility policies. Businesses believe that this will benefit the brand image and generate consumer trust by asserting sustainability. Companies such as Carrefour, Danone, and L'Or√©al have committed to ambitious target levels in regard to reducing their environmental footprints through sustainable packaging.

Technological improvement: Advances in packaging technology made it easier and more economical for businesses to embrace green packaging. These are the development and commercialization of new materials, such as the emergence of biodegradable plastics, newly engineered compostable packaging, or other plant-derived alternatives. This could put forward a wide range of opportunities with regard to sustainable packaging.

Market Segments
By Material:

Paper and Paperboard: Paper and paperboard are covered under highly used green packaging materials because they are recyclable and biodegradable at a high rate; they have broad applications in packaging food and beverages and consumer goods. Other than that, they are highly utilized. Bioplastics are equally popular and are made from renewable materials, such as corn starch and sugarcane. They are strong in the same way as conventional plastics but compostable or biodegradable.
Metal: Metal, such as aluminum cans, can easily be recycled. Several industries use metal packaging as a medium, such as the food and beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals industries.

Glass: It is a material of green package, and easy to recycle. It is considered perfect for the packaging of beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. This is due to the fact that it is inert in nature, and thus the quality of the product can be preserved.

Food and Beverage: The industry involved in food and beverage is one of the largest implementers of green packaging in France.
