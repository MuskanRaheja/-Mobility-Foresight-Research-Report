# Global Portable Fingertip Pulse Oximeter Market 2024-2030
Overview
During the past years, the global portable fingertip pulse oximeter market has grown leaps and bounds, which has resulted from increased awareness of personal health monitoring, coupled with an increase in the prevalence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases that need non-invasive diagnostic tools. Small in size, portable fingertip pulse oximeters have been an important tool in clinical settings and home health monitoring. These measure the levels of oxygen saturation in the blood, expressed as SpO2, and pulse rates. The COVID-19 pandemic further hastened this demand, where these devices were very important in monitoring patients with respiratory complications.

Market Drivers
Increasing Burden of Respiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases: Increasing cases of respiratory diseases, which include COPD, asthma, and pneumonia, along with increasing cases of cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure, have been the major factors responsible for the growth of the pulse oximeter market. Among such diseases, measurement of oxygen saturation is one of the key parameters in the management of patients. A finger-type pulse oximeter has, therefore, become an essential device that must be used by the patient.

Increasing Geriatric Population: Older persons are more likely to develop respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. According to the World Health Organization estimates, by the year 2050, the population of 60-year-old and above will double. It is envisioned that this increased ratio will raise demand for pulse oximeters in the global market because the geriatric population is more prone to chronic illness that requires continuous monitoring of oxygen levels in their bodies.

The COVID-19 pandemic underlined the need for blood oxygen level monitoring, especially in the mild and moderate stages of the disease. COVID-19 is a kind of respiratory virus, and it mostly attacks the lungs; this is why pulse oximeters became one of the leading tools for the detection of potential respiratory problems during the pandemic. It necessitated a market during the pandemic, creating an upward surge in demand due to health care providers and individuals showing interest in the monitoring of oxygen levels at home; hence, it grew unsurprisingly.

Technical Development: Enhancement of technology in pulse oximeters entails developing high-accuracy sensors, adding Bluetooth connectivity, and integrating with smartphones for easy operations of such devices. This is regarding the manufacturing process where the equipment is compact and user-friendly to enable consumers to measure their health metrics in real time, store data, and share it with health practitioners.
