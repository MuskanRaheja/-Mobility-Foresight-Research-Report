# Global Aircraft Landing Gear Actuator Market 2023-2030
# Introduction
Aircraft landing gear is considered an integral part of the landing system of an aircraft. It extend and retract to engage in safe and efficient take offs and landings, in addition to ground maneuvers. Aircraft landing gear actuators' markets around the world will expand rapidly with growing demands of aircraft in the commercial, defense, and general aviation sectors. The growth is attributed to the technology advancements, increased aircraft production, and air travel growth across the globe.


This detailed report will cover the aircraft landing gear actuator market, the key segments, market trends, and the competitive landscape.


Market Drivers
Rising Air Traffic and Aircraft Deliveries: New demand for aircraft is directly proportional to the growing air passenger traffic. This remains a major growth driver for the market of landing gear actuators. As per IATA, global air passenger traffic is expected to double before 2037. Emerging economies, particularly those in Asia-Pacific and Middle East, are heavily investing in their expansion of aviation infrastructure. With the necessity of updating aircraft fleets by airlines, manufacturers of aircraft continue to increase production, which also creates an additional demand for landing gear actuators.


Technological progress is one area wherein the aerospace industry is getting very rapid growth. Major emphases are given in each aspect on fuel efficiency, reduced weight, and automation, so landing gear actuators are being evolved too. Now, electric actuators are gaining very significant rise compared to traditional hydraulic systems due to the reduced weight and energy consumption, making them optimal for all modern aircraft. This technological progress in the market is reshaping landscapes, spurring growth, and creating opportunities for new entrants.


Military Aviation Spending: Increased Defense Budgets in Different Countries: Defense spending in most of the countries is on the rise, and there is a focus on various upgradation aspects of military fleets. The advanced landing gear system is one essential aspect as it is very essential in fighter jets, transport aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The growth in military aircraft demand is one of the major factors driving the landing gear actuator market.


Demand for Lightweight and Fuel-Efficient Aircraft: Fuel-efficient aircraft demand has led to the use of lightweight materials and components in aircraft manufacturing. Thus, advancement in landing gear actuators using lighter materials such as composites and titanium is dictated. Lightweight solutions would likely contribute to an acceleration of the market's growth curve.


Market Restraints
High Development and Maintenance Costs: The development of sophisticated landing gear actuators would be costly for a significant investment in R&D. Additionally, the maintenance and replacement of these parts are expensive, especially for older aircraft. These high costs will challenge market growth-especially for smaller airlines and operators with limited finances.


Strict Regulatory Norms: The aerospace industry is highly regulated, and control over aircraft component design, manufacturing, and testing is excellent. Compliance is inherently laborious and expensive, and the entry of new technologies is thus delayed and can impact market expansion.


Market Segmentation
The aircraft landing gear actuator market can be segmented into three types: type, aircraft type, and region


By Type:


Hydraulic Actuators - Traditionally, hydraulic actuators have been the mainstay used in the landing gear system. The hydraulic actuators possess high power density and high reliability
Electromechanical Actuators: Features such as lightweight, energy-efficient design, which helps in minimizing the complex hydraulic systems, thereby reducing aircraft weight have made them so widely liked
By Aircraft Type:


Commercial Aircraft: It is expected to be the largest contributor in the global market, with air travel picking pace. There is an increasing demand for narrow and wide-body airplanes across the world in both developed and emerging markets, which is acted as a huge growth driver.
Military Aircraft: The defense segment is seeing rapid growth, with investments going into fighter jets and transport aircraft. There is a growing requirement for high-tech military actuators, driving this segment.
Business Jets and General Aviation: Advances in private air travel and increasing the number of business jets are helping spur the demand for landing gear actuators in the segment.
