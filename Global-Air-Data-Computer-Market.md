# Global Air Data Computer Market 2023-2030
The world air data computer market is expected to grow significantly between 2023 and 2030 due to increasing demand for advanced aviation technologies, stringent safety regulations, and growing applications in both civil and military aircraft. An air data computer is a very important component in an aircraft responsible for processing vital flight data like airspeed, altitude, and temperature by interpreting signals from the aircraft's pitot-static system. Such information can help ensure safe and efficient flight activities. The growth of the air data computer market is driven by factors such as the evolution of the aviation industry, technological advancements, and increased demand for new aircraft.


Market Overview
The air data computer market is growing steadily and is expected to witness further accelerated growth in the forecast period. Contributing factors include recovery of global air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased defense spending, and rising production of commercial aircraft. Notably, the ADC market is a part of a bigger avionics market, characterized increasingly by growth due to modernization in the military and civil aviation sectors.


The market size of air data computer was about USD 700 million in 2023, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 5.5% from 2023 to 2030. It is estimated that market size is expected to surpass the figure of USD 1.1 billion by the year 2030.
Major Market Drivers


Modern Avionics Systems: Advanced air data computers- The next-generation air data computers are the very recent incorporations into the market; more accurate, lower power consumption, and more compact make them a must for the new generation of aircraft.
Growing Demand for UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles): The increasing acceptance of drones for everything from military reconnaissance to commercial deliveries has increasingly called for a more advanced air data computer.
Aircraft Deliveries Increasing: Boeing, Airbus, and other aircraft manufacturers witness increased orders for both commercial and military aircraft, thus raising demand for ADCs.
Challenges:


R&D Charges: Highly advanced air data computers carry big R&D expenses. The cost also arises in the sophistication of producing multiple data sources and integrating it into a reliable and accurate system.
Regulatory Hurdles: Aircraft components, such as ADCs, face very stringent regulations to ensure safety, which slows down the product development and release.
Segmentation Analysis
The air data computer market is segmented into the type, aircraft type, end-user, and region.
1. Based on Type
Analog Air Data Computer: This had traditionally been used in old aircraft and is less sophisticated; still, they are applied in some applications.
Digital Air Data Computer: Due to their higher accuracy, reliability, and also compatibility with advanced avionics systems, they become widely used in the modern aircraft.
2. By Aircraft Type:
Commercial Aircraft: This segment will constitute the largest share in terms of market size, given the large number of commercial flights and growing fleet size across the globe. Commercial aircraft have ADCs to maintain optimal flight conditions as well as for safety purposes.
Military Aircraft: The defense budgets of many countries and the inducting next-generation fighter jets, UAVs, and military helicopters would drive demand in this segment.
Business Jets: Business and private air travel is growing constantly, which is driving the business jet market itself.
Drones/UAVs: Fast-paced adoption of the use of drones in military as well as commercial fields has increased the need for complex ADC systems.
3. By End-User:
Original Equipment Manufacturers: The air data computers are mainly used by the aircraft manufacturers. OEMs like Boeing, Airbus, and Lockheed Martin fit ADCs in newly manufactured aircraft.
Aftermarket: This segment deals with maintaining, repairing, and replacing ADC systems that already exist in an aircraft. Growth in this segment will be strong because most aircraft in the market are old and require upgradation.
