# Global GNSS Receiver Module Market 2022-2030
This GNSS receiver module market is sure to experience tremendous exponential growth between 2022â€“2030, driven by the surging demand for accurate navigation and positioning capabilities within diversified industries such as automobile, aerospace, agriculture, and telecommunication. GNSS receiver modules are used to decode and receive signals from multiple satellite constellations that include GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou. As the world increases dependency on location-based services and connected devices, the GNSS receiver module market is expected to grow at a very considerable pace throughout the forecast period.


Market Overview
1. Definition and Function of GNSS Receiver Modules:
These modules take the signal obtained from global navigation satellite systems and decode it into positioning, navigation, and timing information. The application of GNSS receiver modules is now implemented in more applications ranging from smartphones and wearable devices to even the latest issues like autonomous vehicles and drones. Better satellites along with addition of further constellations have brought more accuracy, reliability, and efficiency for GNSS receiver modules.


2. Market Drivers
The following are some key growth drivers of the GNSS receiver module market:
Increased demand for GPS-enabled devices: Continued increasing availability of smartphones, wearables, and IoT products has become increasingly dependent on GNSS technology that, for the first instance, increased demand for this product.


In addition to autonomous vehicle deployments and the demand for high-end ADAS, the automotive sector also faces a large increase in receiver modules for high-precision.
Precision Agriculture: With minimum costs and producing the required crop at higher efficiency, more farmers are nowadays using GNSS-based precision agriculture techniques.


Increased Drone Technology: Drones are also increasingly being applied in the construction sector, logistics, and agriculture, thereby increasing demand for developing GNSS receiver modules that offer relatively accurate location information.


Telecommunication and 5G Infrastructure: Further advancement of 5G networks has also created greater demand for accurate timing and synchronization and thus more advanced GNSS technology as well.


3. Key Restraints and Challenges:
The market for GNSS receiver modules is full of promise but facing a lot of challenges that need to be addressed in the following ways:


Signal Jamming and Spoofing: Since the GNSS signals are quite prone to interference, their performance and accuracy may degrade especially in most applications such as military and aviation industries.


The high-precision modules are costly: whereas mass market GNSS modules are relatively cheap, the aerospace and defense variants are expensive and, therefore, not feasible for the cost-sensitive industries.


Environmental Limitation: The GNSS signals suffer interference; therefore, the system performance will be degraded by atmospheric and obstructions such as tall buildings and dense foliage in urban and forested environments.


Market Segmentation
The global GNSS receiver module market can be classified by type, application, and region.


1. By Type:
Single-frequency GNSS receiver modules: The reception of signal from single frequency band is established by this type of receiver module. Generally, mass-market applications of consumer electronic products like smart phones and wearables use this receiver module because moderate accuracy is affordable but good enough for a consumer market.


Multi-frequency GNSS receiver modules receive signals coming from various frequency bands, thereby increasing the accuracy while reducing interference effects. They make use of modules in high-precision applications, like surveying, geospatial mapping, and even in an autonomous car.


2. Based on Application
Consumer Electronics: The biggest consumers of GNSS receiver modules are smartphone, tablet, and wearable devices. Demand for this segment will continue to be tremendous with the rapidly rising smartphone penetration globally and increasing acceptance and popularity of fitness trackers and smartwatches.


Automotive: GNSS receiver modules are integrated in many application areas of navigation systems, fleet management, and growing interest in autonomous vehicles. The car business's expansion in electric and connected vehicles presents opportunities for growth in GNSS adoption activities.


Aerospace & Defense: GNSS receiver modules are applied in avionics, amongst other applications such as navigation, surveillance, and timing. Modules in this kind of application are used in defense sectors due to missile guidance, positioning of troops, and reconnaissance.


Agriculture: Precision agriculture, applied on grounds like the mapping of fields, soil sampling, and tractor guidance through the aid of GNSS, would further increase in adoption, particularly in developed markets, North America and Europe.


Telecommunication: GNSS is used in the telecommunication sector for high accuracy time synchronization of network infrastructure. This is one of the most crucial requirements for efficient functioning in 5G and future networks.


Others: Other applications of the GNSS receiver modules are found in the marine, construction, mining, and logistics sectors.
