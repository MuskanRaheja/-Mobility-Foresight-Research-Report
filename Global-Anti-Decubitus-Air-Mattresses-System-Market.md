This would involve investments in advanced medical devices, such as anti-decubitus air mattresses, to increase the quality of care and decrease patients' hospital stay.

Material and technology innovation, in particular, continues to drive the market, such as mattresses equipped with smart sensors that track every movement and variation in pressure of the patient; they also provide better patient outcomes, proving to be at the forefront in developed and emerging markets alike.

Awareness and Training: Growing awareness of the need to prevent pressure sores and specialized training for health professionals in the use of these mattresses boost the market growth.
