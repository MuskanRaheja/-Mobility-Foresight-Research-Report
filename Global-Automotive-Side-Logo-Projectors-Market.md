# Global Automotive Side Logo Projectors Market 2023-2030: Trends, Challenges, and Future Growth
The global automotive side-logo projectors market is a fast-growing division of the automotive industry. Otherwise, the projectors are called puddle lights and involve small lighting devices that are installed under the vehicle's side mirrors or doors. When one of the doors opens, the ground is lit from the projection of the vehicle's logo or any other custom design. Primitively a luxury offering, these projectors have now been accommodated in almost every vehicle segment owing to their aesthetic look and functional advantages.

Drivers for the Market
Growing Demand for Vehicle Personalization: Increasing customer demand towards vehicle personalization is one of the major factors driving the growing demand in the market for automotive side logo projectors. The increasing number of consumers who seek differentiation for their cars has a very active response from various vehicle manufacturers and aftermarket suppliers measuring a number of personalization options made available, including logo projectors.

Growing Sales and Production of Vehicles: The growing sales and production of vehicles are growing; these are driving the global market demand for automotive side logo projectors. The automobile industry is growing, primarily in developed and emerging developing nations; hence, the growth in related accessories such as logo projectors has also increased.

Technological Improvement: Over the last few years, following the development of the LED and laser technologies, the quality and efficiency of the automobile side logo projectors increased. These projectors shine brighter through a higher resolution, but for now, it is energy-consuming, and, therefore, much more attractive for users and producers. Technological improvements are likely to further push the market growth.

Growing Market: Although being largely an exclusive attribute of luxury vehicles, side logo projectors started gaining wide acceptance in the aftermarket segment. This made it possible for more people to adapt to the market and use it for its benefits.
Cost Aspect While side logo projectors for automobiles are gaining popularity by the day, their high relative cost means a disadvantage to being adopted at large. So high quality OEM products are sort of a deterrent from being purchased easily by consumers. This is where, either the more price-sensitive markets go for cheaper options or on decision, pass altogether on such accessories.

Low Awareness: Consumer awareness regarding automotive side logo projectors across most parts of the world is relatively very low. This can act to deter growth, especially in developing markets where automotive accessories are not so much in use.

Regulatory Issues: Logo projectors may face a few regulatory issues in some of the more stringent markets if they have a propensity to create glare for incoming traffic or are considered non-compliant with vehicle lighting standards. Regulatory issues are expected to dampen the expansion prospects of the market, especially because a few of the more regulated markets have very high standards.
The global automotive side logo projectors market can be segmented into the following product types based on:

Based on Product Type:

LED Projectors: Of these, LED-based logo projectors are most used, offering high brightness and energy efficiency. The next ones in line are the lesser-used laser projectors, which can produce sharper images and normally find applications only in high-end vehicles. In this strive, the incipient technology may become OLED projectors, improving on the image quality and the flexibility of its customization. By vehicle type, this market is dominated by passenger vehicles, whereas luxury and mid- and high-end are its drivers of adoption.
Commercial Vehicles: While growing, the penetration is still lower in commercial vehicles and is higher in fleet vehicles at the premium end
Two-Wheelers: Though it is still a niche, there is a small but niche market that appears to exist for logo projectors in two-wheelers also
Based on Sales Channel:

OEM: Logo projectors are also an option as part of the offerings through factory-installation by Original Equipment Manufacturers.
Aftermarket: A significant part of the market is catered to by the aftermarket as most of the customers prefer to purchase and get the logo projectors installed post their vehicle purchases.
